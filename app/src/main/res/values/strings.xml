        security has become a very important topic for an
        FTTH network. Fault protection became important
        issues in order to present an efficient FTTH
        network and simultaneously and provide continuous
        services to the end user without being interrupted
        by any failure in fiber lines. The failure at optical
        lines will give two negative impacts. First, the fiber
        cut will cause optical leakage that is able to damage
        our eyes. Second, an interruption will occur during
        the distribution of multimedia service to customers
        for a long period of time. In the traditional method,
        when there is a breakdown in FTTH lines, the engineer
        must go to the failure location to check the optical
        cable using an optical time-domain reflect meter (OTDR).
        The disadvantage of this conventional method is that the
        engineer must leave the Central Office to inject a laser
        from customer location. It will cause inconvenience,
        service disruption and waste valuable time for both
        parties. In this paper, we developed, </string>
